        <ul><li>Cold brew is a coffee prepared by steeping coarsely ground coffee beans in cold water for several hours (usually 12–24 hours).</li>
<li>It has a smoother, less acidic, and naturally sweeter taste compared to regular hot-brewed coffee.</li>
<li>Cold brew is typically served chilled over ice and can be mixed with milk, cream, or flavored syrups.</li>
<li>Because of its slow extraction process, it is often more concentrated and can be diluted before drinking.
